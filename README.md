CS-250-Software Development Lifecycle

Hi! This is my ReadMe file for the Software Development Lifecycle class at Southern New Hampshire University. 

# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this? 
Interpreting user needs into a program is a combination of gathering requirements outlined by the customer and then creating "user stories" out of these requirements. User stories are helpful to attain this because they specificially outline the necessary functionality for the program, making it easier to implement custoemr requirements. 

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Approaching the development of programs is a culmination of various steps that can be refined and tailored to meet specific goals and requirements until a desired outcome is achieved. For my future development work, the agile process I look forward to the most of using is the Scrum process because not only does my company utilize this process but I also feel it's the most effective. 

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development? 
Being a good team member in software development means communicating with others to achieve a desired outcome and faciliate professional growth within a team. Gaining the respect and expertise of teammates is also a crucial aspect of good team development in the software space.
